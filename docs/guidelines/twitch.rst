Twitch chat guidelines
######################

This section will run you through the guidelines you must adhere to in the Twitch chat.

#. Follow Twitch's `Terms of Service <https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/>`_.
#. Do not harass, bully, or discriminate against other chatters.
#. Do not spam or advertise.
#. Do not post NSFW content or have NSFW discussions.
#. Respect the opinions of others. Debate is fine, but keep it civil.
#. Do not ask me to check the Discord server. If you can, send a link to the thing you want to show me in the chat, otherwise I'll look at it afterwards.
#. Backseating is allowed. If you want to send code snippets that might help me out, use a codebin such as `Mystbin <https://mystb.in>`_.
