Invite your bot through the Member Bot Program
##############################################

This section will run you through how to invite your bot to the Discord server through the Member Bot Program.

For your bot to quality for the program:

* It must have a configurable prefix, or rely entirely on slash commands
* It must be hosted 24/7
* The owner must have in the server for at least 28 days
* The owner must have no more than 4 penalty points
* The owner must not already have a bot in the server, unless the bot serves to replace another

On top of this, at least ONE of the following conditions must be satisfied:

* The bot is verified by Discord
* The bot is present on a credible bot list
* The bot is a replacement to another successfully applied bot (provided the old bot joined at least 28 days ago)
* The owner has no penalty points, and has been sufficiently active

While your bot is in the server, it must:

* Follow the :doc:`guidelines <../guidelines/discord>`
* Not send welcome DMs
* Not react to anything other than commands calls and its own mentions
* Not have any owner overrides

It must also function with the following permissions in the bot usage channels...

* Read Messages
* Send Messages
* Send TTS Messages
* Manage Messages
* Embed Links
* Attach Files
* Use External Emojis
* Add Reactions

...and the following permissions in the logging channel, should it wish to use it:

* Manage Webhooks
* Read Messages
* Send Messages
* Send TTS Messages
* Embed Links
* Attach Files

To apply your bot for the Member Bot Program, you should complete a `Member Bot Program Application <https://forms.gle/fgWoQGP7u2M79J5AA>`_. If your bot fails to abide by the above, it will be removed from the server and you may face sanctions.
