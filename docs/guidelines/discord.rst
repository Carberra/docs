Discord server guidelines
#########################

This section will run you through the guidelines you must adhere to in the Discord server. Moderators reserve the right to make their own decisions on what does and does not count as a violation.

#. Follow Discord's `Terms of Service <https://discord.com/terms>`_ and `Community Guidelines <https://discord.com/guidelines>`_.
#. Do not harass, bully, or discriminate against other members.
#. Do not spam or advertise (:doc:`except classifieds <../guides/classifieds>`). This generally covers anything excessive or unsolicited.
#. Do not post NSFW content or have NSFW discussions.
#. Make your display name and avatar presentable:
    - Make sure you can be mentioned on UK and US keyboards.
    - Do not hoist your display name.
    - Do not include the at sign (@), the number sign (#) or angle brackets (<>) in your display name.
    - Keep your avatar SFW.
#. Speak English.
#. Use the support channels for support queries.
#. Do not spoon-feed or ask to be spoon-fed.
#. Support clients should only mention members when necessary:
    - Only directly mention members who are currently helping you.
    - Only mention a helper role once per case, and only after waiting 30 minutes.
#. Respect the opinions of others. Debate is fine, but keep it civil.
#. Do not send content which contains material that could trigger medical conditions or cause damage to others, such as earrape or flashing visuals.

Reporting violations
====================

If it is an emergency, mention the Moderator role. Otherwise. if you wish to report another member discretely, you can send a message to the moderators using the modmail system. To do this, DM the Modmail bot. In doing this, you provide all moderators permission to DM you if they need to follow up on your report. Please do not use the modmail system for anything other than reporting a guideline violation; you will receive a warning if you misuse it.
