Become a helper
###############

This section will run you through how to become a helper in the Discord server.

To qualify for the Helper position, you must:

- Have been in the server for at least 14 days
- Have no more than 6 penalty points to your name

If you meet all the above requirements, you should complete a `Helper Application <https://forms.gle/YXEJedMBTm6DBEwo6>`_, followed by the Python General Competence Test, which you can find in the Helper Application. If you pass the test, you will be given the Helper role. More specific roles, such as the Discord Bot Helper role will be given to you by Carberra after showing you are able to help in those areas.
