Series lifecycles
#################

Every series has a lifecycle, which is comprised of up to four stages.

1. **Up-to-date**: Videos are still being made, requests are still being accepted, and full series support is available anywhere.
2. **Deprecated**: Videos are no longer being made (except where important changes can be easily accounted for), requests are no longer being accepted, but support is generally still available anywhere.
3. **Abandoned**: Videos are no longer being made, and breaking changes will send the series to stage 4. Support is generally unavailable, but helpers in the Discord server might still wish to help regardless.
4. **Broken**: The series no longer works, and no support will be given.
