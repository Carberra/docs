Discord server guidelines
#########################

This section will run you through the guidelines you must adhere to in the Discord server. Moderators reserve the right to make their own decisions on what does and does not count as a violation.

#. Follow Discord's `Terms of Service <https://discord.com/terms>`_ and `Community Guidelines <https://discord.com/guidelines>`_.
#. Do not harass, bully, or discriminate against other members.
#. Do not spam or advertise (:doc:`except classifieds <../guides/classifieds>`). This generally covers anything excessive or unsolicited.
#. Do not post NSFW content or have NSFW discussions.
#. Keep you profile (display name, avatar, banner, and about me) respectable and appropriate. Your display name should not be hoisted, be mentionable on English keyboards, and be easily pronounceable.
#. Speak English.
#. Use the support channels for support queries.
#. Do not spoon-feed or ask to be spoon-fed.
#. Support clients should only mention members when necessary. This means you can only mention members who are currently helping you and can only mention a single helper role once per case after at least 30 minutes of waiting.
#. Respect the opinions of others. Debate is fine, but keep it civil.
#. Do not send content which contains material that could trigger medical conditions or cause damage to others, such as earrape or flashing visuals.
#. Do not be a nuisance. Examples of nuisance behaviour include persistently ignoring helper advice and generally annoying server members.

Reporting violations
====================

If it is an emergency, mention the Moderator role. Otherwise. if you wish to report another member discretely, you can send a message to the moderators using the modmail system. To do this, DM the Modmail bot. In doing this, you provide all moderators permission to DM you if they need to follow up on your report. Please do not use the modmail system for anything other than reporting a guideline violation; you will receive a warning if you misuse it.
