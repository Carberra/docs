The Carberra difficulty scale
#############################

The scale is designed to give the viewer an idea of how difficult something is going to be before it's shown to them, and allow them to gauge how much time and external research they may need to undertake. This section explains who each difficulty indicator is for.

Programming tutorials
=====================

- **Beginner**: You're new, and are currently learning the fundamentals. You should understand what's going on here before advancing any further.
- **Intermediate**: You've got the fundamentals down, and are looking to stretch out a little. The odd Google search now and then doesn't phase you.
- **Advanced**: You've been going at it for a while, and are really getting the hang of it. You're up for doing some experimentation to make sure you've got it down to a T.
- **Expert**: You're super confident in your abilities, and are looking for a *real* challenge. You're prepared for the extensive research and experimentation needed, because you really want this.
- **Master**: Self-preservation means nothing to you.

Software tutorials
==================

Software tutorials use a simplified version of the above scale.

- **Beginner**: You'll more than likely be able to do this first try, barring any really specific issues.
- **Intermediate**: You'll need to put in some time and effort for this most likely, but you'll get there.
- **Advanced**: You're gonna want to strap in for this.
